Kinetic typography
	Film: Easier to convey emotion, better to tell stories
	Engage users via these methods from film
	Powerful, BUT: under exploited
		Not usually used with interactivity
		Not well explored or understood
		Needs tools
	Express:
		Emotion, characters, then more
	Can only be manipulated so far (sad-> angry, not sad->happy)
	Tone of voice:
		Paralinguistic
			Doesn’t affect meaning
			Vocal qualities
			Hard to express
		Linguistic / Prosodic
			Can effect emphasis and/or meaning
	Prosodic expressions / analogs
		Pitch - large upward or downward movement
		Loudness - chagnes in weight or size
		Tempo - movements with human meaning
	Can manipulate
		Recognition
			Position, typeface, color (who’s talking)
		Alignment
			Attachment
				Following in time and space (view attaches to some characters)
			Subjective access
				How much we know about characters life/emotion
		Allegiance
			Moral response to character
	Rapid Serial Visual Presentation
		One element at a time (serially)
			Can increase reading speed (eyes don’t have to move)
		Small screen displays
			Trade time/space
			Same or better performance in much less space (but can be tiring)
	Lots of potential
