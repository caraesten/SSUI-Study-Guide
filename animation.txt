Animation
	Why?
		Feeling of reality and livelyness
		Visual continuity, perception of change
		Direct attention
	Three principles
		Solidity
			Appear solid
			No teleportation
			Motion blur
			Squash and stretch
			Follow through/ secondary action
		Exaggeration
			Anticipation
			Squash and stretch
			Follow through
		Reinforcement
			Slow in and slow out
			Movement in arcs
			3 parts of motion
				Anticipation, motion, follow through
			Not normally disjoint (overlaps)
	Abstracted via transitions
		Object being animated
		Time interval
		Trajectory
			Curve (2d space, usually)
Pacing function (time interval, determines pacing along curve, slow in slow out)
	To create a movement
		Schedule a transition
			transition_start(), transition_step(), transition_end()
		Typical OS canâ€™t deliver uniform time intervals
