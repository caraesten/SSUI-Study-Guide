Two-handed interaction
	Three key observations:
		Non-dominant hand sets context for dominant
		Tendency for larger scale and lower frequency movements for non-dominant hand
		Motion by non-dominant hand tend to precede those of dominant hand
	Lenses
		In context interaction
			Little/no shift in focus of attention/movement
			Alternate views in context and on demand
			Structured well for 2 handed input
			Alternative to more traditional modes
			Clear affordance for meaning
		Parent forwards damage to lenses
			Typically change any damage that overlaps into whole-lens-area damage
		Output
			Distinct drawing traversal
			Low-level modification of output (ambush approach)
		Things that help
			StartInteractorDraw
			EndInteractiorDraw
	Tape-drawing
	Tool-stone
		Multiple degree of freedom
			Rotate, flip, tilt
			Bar on one side
		Implemented with Wacom Tablet
		Better use for non-dominant hand than pointing or clicking
