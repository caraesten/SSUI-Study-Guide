Learning technologies
	What makes it well designed?
		Analysis of human performance data
		Avoid expert blind spot
	What is ITS?
		Learning by doing, w/ step by step guidance
		Be more flexible, diagnostic, adaptive, individualized
		Use AI techniques
	General ideas
		A system that can solve problems in the various ways students can
		Figure out mistakes /etc
	Direct manipulations
		Ideas:
			Promotes implicit learning, making i more difficult to know when knowledge is relevant.
			W/ more difficult interfaces, cost of action is increased. 
			Advantageous to make fewer moves
			Only certain types of difficulty improve performance (making it cognitively more difficult encourages planning)
		Learning w/ direct interaction can make the situation worse
			Good interfaces != good learning
		Proceed with HCI methods w/ caution
	Visual knowledge
		Neither purely visual knowledge nor purely verbal knowlege is sufficient
		Need integrated visual-verbal knowledge
			Both works when the instruction supports learners to coordinate info from both sources
	What might help?
		Reduce visual cognitive load
		Greater attention to key features
		Support interfaces using visual info
	Measure:
		Change over time
			(pre-post test)
	Results:
		Diagrams help (long term retention of knowledge, less self-explanation errors, less confusion after a correct answer)
		Integrated interface supports visual-verbal learning
	Integrated text = better learning than separated text
	Concurrent narration was even better
	Spatial contiguity principle holds for static illustrations and text
	Contrast
		Golightly: “easier” interface may support better performace but lead to poor learning
		Aleven: “easier” (integrated) interface leads to more learning
		Interface should reduce extraneous cognitive load (eg, mapping between separated representations)
	Should support useful reflection, and avoid shallow strategies
		Golightly: harder interface does that
		B&A: easier interface
