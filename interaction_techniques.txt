Interaction techniques
	Fitts' law:
		Time = A + B*log2(Dist/Size + 0.5)
	Original interactors:
		Buttons
		Scroll-bars
		Radio-buttons
		Check-boxes
		Text-entry fields
		Drop-down menus
		File input dialog
	Second release of MacOS added:
		Lists (Single/multiple selection)
		Textual lists
		Hierarchical menus
		Window maximize box
	Since then:
		Tabbed dialogs
		Hierarchical lists
		Combo boxes
	WIMP: Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers
	Pie menus:
		Hard to do hierarchy
		Affordances not great
		Harder to implement label drawing
	Beating Fitts' law
		Avoid problem
		Use non-pointing device
			Shortcuts, fixed buttons
			Mouse wheel
		Make things "act" bigger
			Map nearby non-legal actions to legal ones "snapping"
